# GitHub Issues Skill

This skill provides a standardized workflow for creating GitHub issues on `g-nogueira/thermo-replacer`. Any agent that needs to create issues should follow this skill instead of ad-hoc issue creation.

## Issue Templates

Issue templates are in [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). Always use the appropriate template:

| Template | When to use |
|---|---|
| [feature.md](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md) | New functionality from PRD, user story, or planning decomposition |
| [bug.md](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md) | Defect found during review, testing, or development |
| [tech-debt.md](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/tech-debt.md) | Architecture improvement, cleanup, refactoring — from design review or code review |
| [spike.md](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/spike.md) | Timeboxed investigation with defined research questions |

## Label Conventions

Apply labels from these categories:

**Component** (at least one required):
- `ble` — BLE client, protocol, GATT operations
- `ui` — Jetpack Compose screens, navigation, theming
- `worker` — WorkManager, background polling
- `ha-integration` — Home Assistant webhook/REST API
- `health-connect` — Health Connect API integration
- `settings` — DataStore preferences, configuration

**Type** (exactly one required):
- `feature` — New functionality
- `bug` — Defect
- `tech-debt` — Refactor or improvement
- `spike` — Research / investigation

**Priority** (for features, from PRD):
- `priority:must-have`
- `priority:should-have`
- `priority:nice-to-have`

**Source** (for traceability):
- `user-story` — Originated from PRD user story
- `design-gap` — Originated from architecture design review
- `review-finding` — Originated from PR review

Create labels if they don't exist yet.

## Issue Creation Workflow

Follow this workflow regardless of which agent is creating the issue.

### Step 1: Select Template

Based on the context, pick the right template:
- **Planner decomposing user stories** → `feature.md`
- **Architect finding design gaps** → `tech-debt.md` or `feature.md` (depending on whether it's a gap or new work)
- **Reviewer finding follow-up issues** → `bug.md` or `tech-debt.md`
- **Implementor discovering scope** → `bug.md`, `tech-debt.md`, or `spike.md`

### Step 2: Read the Template

Read the selected template file from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Fill in every section — leave no `<placeholder>` text in the final issue.

### Step 3: Enrich with Project Context

Before creating the issue, read relevant project docs to fill in technical details:
- `Docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` — for settings, permissions, payload format, architecture references
- `Docs/FINDINGS.md` — for BLE protocol details (when the issue involves BLE communication)
- `docs/arch/` files — for architecture references (if they exist)
- `docs/product/` files — for PRD/user story references (if they exist)

### Step 3b: Verify Context Quality

Before proceeding, check that the issue body you're about to create meets the context quality bar defined in the **task-context** skill (`.github/skills/task-context/SKILL.md`, section "Context Quality for Issue Writing"). A well-written issue should contain enough information that a future agent can gather complete context from the issue alone — without needing to ask the user for clarification.

Verify the issue body contains:
- Clear description of what needs to be done
- Acceptance criteria (specific, testable)
- Affected components
- BLE protocol references (if applicable, with hex values)
- References to relevant project spec sections

### Step 4: Search for Duplicates

Before creating any issue, search the repository for existing issues that may already cover the same topic:
```
Search by title keywords and any reference IDs (US-X, GAP-N, RP-X)
```
If a duplicate or near-duplicate exists, do NOT create a new issue. Instead, note the existing issue number and inform the user.

### Step 5: Present Issue Plan (HITL Gate)

Before creating issues, present a summary table to the user via `vscode/askQuestions`:

| # | Title | Template | Component | Labels |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | ... | feature | ble | `feature`, `ble`, `priority:must-have` |

**Wait for explicit confirmation.** Do not create issues without user approval.

### Step 6: Create Issues

Use GitHub API tools to create each confirmed issue on `g-nogueira/thermo-replacer`:
1. Set the title
2. Set the body (filled template)
3. Apply labels (create missing labels first)
4. Do **NOT** assign users — leave for human triage

### Step 7: Report Created Issues

After creation, present a summary:

| # | Issue | Title | URL |
|---|-------|-------|-----|
| 1 | #NN | ... | link |

Log cross-team events to `.github/agents/activity-log.md` if creating issues as part of a workflow handoff.

## Batch Issue Creation

When creating multiple issues (e.g., Planner decomposing a feature into 5+ tasks):
1. Prepare ALL issues first (Steps 1-4 for each)
2. Present the full batch in a single HITL confirmation (Step 5)
3. Create all confirmed issues in sequence (Step 6)
4. Present the full summary once at the end (Step 7)

## Issue Title Conventions

- **Feature from user story:** `[US-X] <user story title>`
- **Design gap:** `[GAP-N] <concise gap summary>`
- **Bug from review:** `[RP-X] <defect description>`
- **Tech debt:** `<concise description of the improvement>`
- **Spike:** `[Spike] <research question>`

## Rules

- **Every issue must trace to a source** — PRD, design gap doc, review point, or explicit user request
- **Copy acceptance criteria verbatim** when they come from a PRD — never paraphrase
- **Never assign issues** — leave for human triage
- **Always HITL before creation** — no exceptions
- **Search for duplicates first** — never create duplicate issues
